I have a coin that is slightly weighted in favor of heads; it will land on heads 55% of the time.
How would you simulate this in python using the random module?

import random

def simulate_weighted_coin(probability_heads):
    # Generate a random float between 0 and 1
    random_number = random.uniform(0, 1)

    # Check if it lands on heads based on the given probability
    if random_number < probability_heads:
        return "Heads"
    else:
        return "Tails"

# Simulate the coin toss multiple times
num_simulations = 1000  # You can adjust this number
count_heads = 0

for _ in range(num_simulations):
    result = simulate_weighted_coin(0.55)
    if result == "Heads":
        count_heads += 1

# Calculate and print the percentage of times it landed on heads
percentage_heads = (count_heads / num_simulations) * 100
print(f"The coin landed on Heads {percentage_heads:.2f}% of the time.")
