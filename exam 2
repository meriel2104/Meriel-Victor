From A Prior Exam Suppose we had a file called temperature.csv, which contains
the daily high and low temperatures recorded in Philadelphia. The file is composed of three fields per
a line, containing the date, the high temperature, and the low temperature. Each field is separated
commas. For example, the contents of the file might look like this:
11/11/19, 64, 40
11/12/19, 49, 21
11/13/19, 33, 22
... ... ...
Write a program that calculates or prints the following:
5pts The day with the hottest high temperature.
5pts The day with the coldest low temperature.
10pts The average high temperature of the entire file.

def process_temperature_data(file_path):
    # Initialize variables
    hottest_day = None
    coldest_day = None
    total_high_temperature = 0
    total_days = 0

    # Read temperature data from the file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Process each line of the file
    for line in lines:
        date, high_temp, low_temp = map(int, line.strip().split(','))

        # Update hottest day
        if hottest_day is None or high_temp > hottest_day[1]:
            hottest_day = (date, high_temp)

        # Update coldest day
        if coldest_day is None or low_temp < coldest_day[1]:
            coldest_day = (date, low_temp)

        # Update total high temperature
        total_high_temperature += high_temp
        total_days += 1

    # Calculate average high temperature
    average_high_temperature = total_high_temperature / total_days

    # Print results
    print(f"The day with the hottest high temperature: {hottest_day[0]} (Temperature: {hottest_day[1]}°C)")
    print(f"The day with the coldest low temperature: {coldest_day[0]} (Temperature: {coldest_day[1]}°C)")
    print(f"The average high temperature of the entire file: {average_high_temperature:.2f}°C")

# Example usage
file_path = 'temperature_data.txt'  # Replace with the path to your temperature data file
process_temperature_data(file_path)
