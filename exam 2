From A Prior Exam Suppose we had a file called temperature.csv, which contains
the daily high and low temperatures recorded in Philadelphia. The file is composed of three fields per
a line, containing the date, the high temperature, and the low temperature. Each field is separated
commas. For example, the contents of the file might look like this:
11/11/19, 64, 40
11/12/19, 49, 21
11/13/19, 33, 22
... ... ...
Write a program that calculates or prints the following:
5pts The day with the hottest high temperature.
5pts The day with the coldest low temperature.
10pts The average high temperature of the entire file.
